        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p1>
			What's up, my name's Jackson. I'm 18 years old and live in the United States. <br>
			I've been programming for about 5 years. I'm almost entirely self-taught. <br>
			Besides computers, I enjoy talking about politics and reading (about politics, mostly). <br>
			My political beliefs would be pretty closely alligned with Social Democracy, but I prefer not to use
			labels when describing my beliefs. Generally I'll just call myself a "liberal" if ever asked. <br><br>
